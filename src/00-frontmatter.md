_This is an applied research report by [Cloudera Fast Forward](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html). We write reports about emerging technologies.  Accompanying each report are working prototypes that exhibit the capabilities of the algorithm and offer detailed technical advice on its practical application. Read our full report on interpretability below or [download the PDF](/ff06-2020-interpretability.pdf). For this report we built an interpretability prototype: [Refractor](https://refractor.fastforwardlabs.com)._
