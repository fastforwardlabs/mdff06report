_This is an applied research report by [Cloudera Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html). Originially released to subscribers in August 2017, it is now open to the public. We write reports about emerging technologies. Accompanying each report are working prototypes that exhibit the capabilities of the algorithm and offer detailed technical advice on its practical application.
